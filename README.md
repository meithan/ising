# ising
Code to simulate the 2D Ising model

To compile the code, just run in the terminal:
```$ make```

Then run the simulation with:
```$ ./ising <TEMP>```
where ``<TEMP>`` is the Ising model temperature in units of J/K (typical values are 1.0-5.0, with Tc ~ 2.27).

The parameters of the simulation are at the start of file ``ising.cpp``.
